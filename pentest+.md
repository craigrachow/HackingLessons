Exam Essentials

CIA and DAD triads

name several important benefits of penetration testing. Penetration testing provides knowledge about an organization's security posture that can't be obtained elsewhere. It also provides a blueprint for the remediation of security issues. Finally, penetration tests provide focused information on specific attack targets

penetration testing may be conducted to meet regulatory requirements. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requires that organizations involved in the processing of credit card transactions conduct both internal and external penetration tests on an annual basis

Describe how both internal and external teams may conduct penetration tests. Internal teams have the benefit of inside knowledge about the environment. They also operate more cost effectively than external teams. External penetration testers have the benefit of organizational independence from the teams who designed and implemented the security controls. Know the five phases of the penetration testing process. Penetration testers begin in the Engagement Management phase, where they develop a statement of work and agree with the client on rules of engagement. They then move into reconnaissance efforts during the Reconnaissance and Enumeration phase. The information collected is then used to discover vulnerabilities in the Vulnerability Discovery and Analysis phase and conduct attacks during the Attacks and Exploits phase. After the final phase, Post exploitation and Lateral Movement, the team shares its findings with the target organization. Describe the tools used by penetration testers. Tools designed for use by cybersecurity professionals and other technologists may also assist penetration testers in gathering information and conducting attacks. Penetration testers use specialized exploitation frameworks, such as Metasploit, to help automate their work
